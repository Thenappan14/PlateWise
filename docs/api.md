## `POST /analyze` (NEW — Combined Flow)

**Recommended endpoint for single-step menu analysis.**

Combines file upload, menu extraction, nutrition enrichment, and dietary-based ranking in one request.

Request: Multipart form upload

- Accepts: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.pdf`
- Requires the user to have completed their profile (same as `/recommendations/{menu_id}`)

Response:

```json
{
  "upload_id": 1,
  "menu_id": 1,

}
```

This endpoint handles all steps internally:
1. Stores the uploaded file
2. Extracts and OCR if needed
3. Enriches items with estimated nutrition, allergens, ingredients
4. Generates AI-powered recommendations based on user's dietary profile
5. Returns ranked results immediately

## `POST /uploads`

- Accepts: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.pdf`
